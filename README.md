- ▶️ GUI allows start and stop logging

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python 3
- pynput for capturing keyboard input
- Tkinter for GUI

## 🌟 Benefits
- Teaches system input monitoring concepts
- Provides insight into how malicious keyloggers work
- Helps learners understand defensive security

## ⚠️ Ethical Note
Keyloggers must be used **only for education and research**. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.
